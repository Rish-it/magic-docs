## Introduction

I was recently granted access to the [OpenAI GPT-3 Beta](https://beta.openai.com/), a very powerful language model that can be used to do all sorts of magic like chat bot generation, article summary, and a [lot more cool stuff](https://beta.openai.com/examples).

But the application that really excited me was creative writing, particularly poetry and story generation. This document details my experiments and findings.

## Main Content

### What is GPT-3?

[GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) is a language model developed by [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/). It's a powerful tool for natural language processing tasks. Trained on an estimated **45 TB** of text data, GPT-3 can generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on given prompts.

### Method

To explore GPT-3's capabilities in poetry, I provided direct requests and examples, allowing the AI to generate responses. Here's how I structured my experiments:

#### Short Poem

**Prompt:** Write a short poem.

**Sample Response:**
```
Snow is falling,
silently,
the ground a white blanket.
Heroes dream in peace,
where they sleep.
```

### Results

#### Short Poem with Theme

**Prompt:** Write a short poem about space exploration.

**Sample Response:**
```
I hope the stars align
For I dream and explore
Beyond what we see,
With the most amazing views
```

## Conclusion

GPT-3 has demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating creative text. While not all generated content is perfect, many samples are surprisingly coherent and creative. Further experimentation can help unlock more potential uses.
